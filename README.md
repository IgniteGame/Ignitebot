# Ignitebot

A discord bot for Ignite

If you'd like to add the bot to your own server, here's the link: 
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=429839546977615882&scope=bot

### What it Does

- Ignitebot rolls dice and gets card data

- Say "!ignitebot" followed by a command in a group chat, or just a command in a PM

**Commands:**

- "-ignite" rolls ignite dice

- You can also type "data:" followed by a card name to recieve its stats. For example: "data:molten maniac"

- "help" gives you help, "rolls" tells you how many dice have been rolled and how many you've rolled 

- You can also roll custom dice, such as "d4", which rolls a 4 sided die

### Tips

If you're going to use Ignite Bot in a server, we recommend using a seperate text channel just for rolling so it doesn't clutter other channels and so people can mute that channel.

### To Do

- Add an option to list a whole deck, and show stats for the deck

- Send a permalink to the requested card
